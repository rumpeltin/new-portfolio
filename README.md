## May I present... 🥁🥁🥁 my new portfolio!

This is something I've worked on for quite a while now. <br>
My old, currently still active, portfolio simply didn't accurately represent my skillset. <br>
<br>
That's why I've uploaded my new portfolio to this shiny new repo hoping to put it online in a matter of days. <br>
...maybe weeks bc I still have to make it mobile-friendly & do some cross-browser testing.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I'm glad to have made the step of uploading it and can't wait to host it in its very own S3 bucket!<br>
The domain is already secured...<br>
<br>
I'll keep you guys updated!
